## Tips

1. Replace DESCRIPTION with a brief, clear explanation of the change.
2. Replace #ISSUE_REFER with reference to the issues opened.
3. Keep the description concise but informative.
4. Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
5. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
6. Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

Remember, good commit messages help others understand the history and purpose of changes in the codebase.
